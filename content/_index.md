2024 to keep doing what they do best: teach Rust, make videos, and maintain
open-source software.

## Open source

bearcove maintains big Rust projects:

  * [**facet**](https://facet.rs) — reflection for Rust, powering serialization, deserialization, pretty printing, and more
  * [**dodeca**](https://dodeca.bearcove.eu/) — a fully incremental static site generator where dev mode = production mode
  * [**roam**](https://roam.bearcove.eu/) — Rust-native RPC, friendly to other languages via facet-powered codegen
  * [**picante**](https://picante.bearcove.eu/) — an async incremental query runtime, like Salsa but Tokio-friendly
  * [**vixen**](https://github.com/bearcove/vixen) — a Rust build system

Some smaller crates:

  * [**figue**](https://github.com/bearcove/figue) — a CLI, config file, and environment variables parser, based on facet
  * [**rediff**](https://github.com/bearcove/rediff) — a diff and assertion library for Facet types
  * [**squiggles**](https://github.com/bearcove/squiggles) — an LSP that runs cargo nextest and reports back as diagnostics
  * [**rc-zip**](https://github.com/bearcove/rc-zip) — a sans-io ZIP implementation in Rust focused on compatibility
