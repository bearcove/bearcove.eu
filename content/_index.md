# bearcove

**bearcove** was founded by [@fasterthanlime](https://fasterthanli.me) in late
2024 to keep doing what they do best: teach Rust, make videos, and maintain
open-source software.

## Open source

bearcove maintains big Rust projects:

  * [facet](https://facet.rs) — a take on reflection in Rust, allows a ton of nice use cases
  * [home](https://home.bearcove.eu) — the CMS that powers this websites and several others

Some smaller crates:

  * [rubicon](https://github.com/bearcove/rubicon) — macros to make dangerous dynamic linking pattern in Rust a little safer
  * [dylo](https://github.com/bearcove/dylo) — enables "impl" and "consumer" crates when doing dynamic linking
  * [rc-zip](https://github.com/bearcove/rc-zip) — a sans-io ZIP implementation in Rust focused on compatibility
  * [timelord](https://github.com/fasterthanlime/timelord) — restores timestamps between builds to let cargo and Rust build scripts see that the build is clean

The following are not actively being maintained:

  * [loona](https://github.com/bearcove/loona) — an HTTP/1+2 implementation on top of io_uring, with kTLS support (on hold)
  * [merde](https://github.com/bearcove/merde) — another take on serialization with declarative macros and "metastack" support (superseded by facet)

## Content creation

bearcove operates:

  * <https://fasterthanli.me> with long-form Rust content
  * <https://youtube.com/@fasterthanlime> with a variety of tech videos

That content receives funding through:

  * <https://github.com/sponsors/fasterthanlime>
